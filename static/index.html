            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                I grew up in Joliet Illinois and a senior at Lewis. I am currently living with my parents and have 2 siblings.
                My older brother graduated from Northern Illinois University and my younger sister is a sophomore at Southern Illinois Unviersity of Edwardsville.
                My dad works at Cisco Systems and has been a big influence on me pursuing a degree in technology. I am majoring in computer science because
                I love working with new technology and problem solving.

            <h4>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h4>

            </ul>
            <h4>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h4>
            <p>
                My favorite hobby would be mixed martial arts. I love the idea of mixing different martial arts for sport and testing them against each other.
                I have been training in Muay Thai, Boxing, and Jiu Jitsu for the past 3 years and have developed a passion for it. I enjoy watching the UFC
                and seeing professionals mixing the arts together or seeing a person so dominant in one art that they force their opponent into fighting their fight. 
                People get the misperception that it is just a bunch of people throwing punches and holding each other but the technicality
                goes far beyond that. It is a sport of thinking.
            </p>
            <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
            <p>
                A fun fact about me is that I am a boxing coach. I have been training in mixed martial arts for years
                and the opportunity opened in August of 2022 at the gym I have been training at so I decided to spread my knowledge
                on the sport.
